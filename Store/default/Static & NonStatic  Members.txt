static and non static members
---------------------------------
Java allows:
 * Blocks 
 * Data Members
 * Methods
 * Nested Classes
to be declared as "static" or left out as "non static".


non static blocks
---------------------
non static blocks are initializer blocks
for objects of the class.

They auto execute per object created and
assign initial value to the non static
data members.



static blocks
-----------------
static blocks are initializer blocks
for static data members of the class.

They auto execute as a part of class 
initialization process.



non static data members
--------------------------
* Data members of a class are by default non static.
* Non static data members are declared inside the object as a member.
* Their life is equal to the life of the object.
* They are accessible through the object.

static data members
-----------------------
* Data members of a class can be declared as static.
* static data members are not allocated as the object member but they remain as a member of the class.
* Their life is equal to the life of the class.
* They are accessible through the class reference.

non static methods
----------------------
* Methods of a class are by default non static.
* Non static methods require a caller object for invokation.
* They can directly access all other members of the class.

static methods
-----------------
* Methods of a class can be declared as static.
* static methods dont require a caller object for invokation. Ideally they are called using the class reference.
* They can directly access only the static members of the class.
